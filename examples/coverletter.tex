\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
I am an enthusiastic and skilled engineer in robotics and software development with over 5 years of experience. In my spare time I enjoy spending time tinkering with my drone project or learning new technical skills.

\lettersection{Why Autonomous Teaming Solutions?}
In the current European climate, I have realised how important it is to have peaceful times and security. Your mission to improve and enhance military capabilities in the field to ensure this is what caught my eye. I am motivated by this opportunity to contribute to the safety of myself and others by developing advanced software solutions that would help ensure this.

\lettersection{Why I would be a good fit?}
Through my years of experience, I have worked on multiple areas of robotics startups as well in commercial shipping industry. During my work, I have developed algorithms for SLAM, using either LIDARs or Radar solutions, integrated sensor fusion to have better pose estimation in GNSS denied areas (remote orchard farms) as well developed detection and tracking software package for landmark based SLAM algorithm. This includes developing automation tools for faster results gathering and analysis of the collected data. 

At work, I am always a team player first and prefer to find solutions to the problems as a team. In all my positions, I have closely worked with my colleagues with weekly/bi-weekly project planning to have highest priority tasks done first. In my current position, I am the lead engineer in the localisation and mapping team.

I would appreciate a further discussion for the position and looking forward to your reply.
